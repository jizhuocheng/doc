Since the webpages generated by `teedoc` are static webpages, you can deploy them directly in the usual way of deploying static pages.

The page generated by `teedoc` will be in the `out` directory

Using `teedoc serve` will start a `HTTP` service, but please do not use it in a production environment, it is unreliable

For the production environment, here are a few simple and practical methods:

* [Deploy to github pages](./deploy_github_pages.md)
* [Use nginx to deploy to self-built server](./deploy_nginx.md)
* [Use CDN to accelerate website](./deploy_cdn.md)
