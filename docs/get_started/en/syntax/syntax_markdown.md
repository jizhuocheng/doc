> This article is a document written using `Markdown`, using the page effect generated by `teedoc`, the source code of `Markdown` file can be found [here](https://github.com/teedoc/teedoc.github.io/blob/main/docs/get_started/en/syntax/syntax_markdown.md)

## Markdown using brief

The file placed under the document directory, if it is a recognized file, such as `*.md`, it will be converted to `*.html`, if it is not recognized, such as `*.jpg`, it will be copied intact into the output folder (`out`).

The default `Markdown` parsing is done by the plugin `teedoc-plugin-markdown-parser`, which is used by default in the template project.

If you need to link the documentation to the left directory, configure it in `sidebar.json` or `sidebar.yaml`.

If you have used `Markdown`, it is also highly recommended to spend 2 minutes browsing it!


## Markdown basic content format

You need to confirm that a `markdown` parser plugin is enabled in `site_config.json`, such as `teedoc-plugin-markdown-parser`.

Create a folder or file in the directory corresponding to `config.json`, such as `get_started/zh/syntax/syntax_markdown.md` (`README.md` will eventually generate `index.html`), pay attention to use `UTF- 8` file encoding (do not use `Windows` default Notepad), it is recommended to use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + `Markdown Preview Enhanced` plugin, the default file will be `UTF-8 `Encoding, if not, you can also click the encoding in the lower right corner and click the pop-up option `Save with encoding` and select `UTF-8` to change the encoding.

### Markdown metadata header

Each `md` file can add a header, also called `metadata` (metadata in Chinese). The article information is set through these key values, and the format is `yaml` format. Of course, this file header is optional, or you can Do not write

```markdown
---
title: markdown syntax
tags: teedoc, markdown, syntax
keywords: teedoc, markdown, syntax
desc: teedoc's markdown syntax introduction and examples
id: zh_readme
class: zh_readme
draft: false
# Start with a # sign to indicate a comment
---
```

* `title`: the title of the article, can be used if there is no metadata header
```markdown
# Article title
```
or
```markdown
article title
===
```

* `keywords`: Keywords, multiple keywords separated by commas `,` will be added to the `html` header, which is convenient for search engines to crawl, and will not be displayed on the page. Can also be written in `yaml` list format
```markdown
keywords:
  - teedoc
  - markdown
  - grammar
```
* `desc`: The page description will be added to the `html` header and will not be displayed on the page, which is convenient for search engines to crawl
* `tags`: article tags, which will be displayed on the page. Multiple tags are separated by commas `,`, or they can be written in the format of `yaml` list, same as `keywords`
* `id`: The `id` of the page, which will be added to the `html` tag, such as `<html id="zh_readme">...</html>`, usually not needed, usually in a single page for a certain page It may be used when customizing `css` alone, it will override the settings in `config.json`
* `class`: page `class`, separated by commas `,`, can not be set, it will override the settings in `config.json`. For example, you can set the `css` style of a specific page by setting this value. For specific supported styles, see [theme plugin documentation](../plugins/themes.md)
* `layout`: The layout template used by the page. By default, the configuration in the theme plugin will be used. If you need to customize the layout of this page, you can set this parameter. The path is relative to the path set by `layout_root_dir` in `site_config`, `layout_root_dir` defaults to `layout`, so to use `layout/special_layout.html` just fill in `special_layout.html`. For layout template syntax see [layout documentation](../usage/layout_template.md)
* `date`: the last update date, the format is `2022-09-15`
  * If not set: The last modification time of the file will be used by default. If it is a `git` repository, it will automatically get the time of the last commit of the page from `git`. The system reads the last modified time (this is most likely inaccurate). In addition, if `update` is filled with a value, the latest modification date in `update` will be used
  * If you don't want to show the last modified date, disable it by setting the value to `false`
  * If the `update` value is set, the value in `date` will still be used first
* `update`: update history, an update history table will be generated at the beginning of the article, format:
```markdown
update:
  - date: 2022-09-15
    author: author1
    version: 1.1.0
    content: updated xxx
  - date: 2022-08-05
    author: author2
    version: 1.0.0
    content: updated xxx
```
* `update_open`: display update history or not, default `true`, set to `false` will collapse update history(supported by theme plugin)
* `draft`: Whether it is a draft, the default is `false`. If set to `true`, this file will be ignored when generating the page.

### Markdown content

The content is written in `Markdown` syntax, because the main title will be converted into a `<h1>` tag, so it is recommended to start with the second-level title in the content. Such a page has only one `<h1>` tag, which is convenient for search engines to crawl take, such as

```markdown
---
title: teedoc
---

## Title one

content. . .

## title two

content. . .
```

## title

### Level 3 heading

#### Level 4 heading

#### Level 4 Heading 2

#### Level 4 Heading 3

##### Level 5 heading

###### Level 6 heading

## Emoji

The `emoji` syntax is not currently supported, but you can directly copy the emoji from the `emoji` to the document, for example:
🍊 🍇 😀 😅 😇

## superscript

H~2~O, y = x^2^

.. details::Markdown source code, click to expand
    ```markdown
    H~2~O, y = x^2^
    ```

## picture

Resource files will be copied to the output folder (`out`), so the most important thing is how to reference them in the documentation
* The easiest and recommended method
  Use relative paths:
  Resource files can be placed in the corresponding directory of the document, such as document `docs/get_started/zh`, you can create `docs/get_started/zh/assets/images/logo.png`,
  Then use relative path references in `docs/get_started/en/README.md`, i.e. `![](assets/images/logo.png)`
* Advanced method
  This situation is suitable for multiple documents referencing resources in the same folder (`url`), which is convenient for maintaining multiple documents, such as multilingual translation, or reducing `CDN` traffic consumption.
  Use resources outside the document path, configured in `site_config.json`
  ```json
  {
      "route": {
          "docs": {
              "/get_started/en/": "docs/get_started/en",
          },
          "assets": {
              "/get_started/assets/": "docs/get_started/assets"
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  This setting will copy the entire directory of `docs/get_started/assets` to `/get_started/assets`
  So just use relative path references in `docs/get_started/en/README.md`, i.e. `![](../assets/images/logo.png)`


To display this image, you need to set the `route` key in `site_config.json`

![This is an image](../../assets/images/logo.png)
![This is an image](../assets/images/logo.png)

![This is an image](../../assets/images/logo.png)![This is an image](../assets/images/logo.png)

.. details::Markdown source code, click to expand
    ```markdown

    ![This is an image](../assets/images/logo.png)

    ![This is an image](../../assets/images/logo.png)![This is an image](../assets/images/logo.png)
    ```

## video

Use the HTML `video` tag directly:

```html
<video src="https://****.com/***.mp4" controls="controls" preload="auto">your brower not support play video</video>
```

There is no video here, so it is blank, put in the correct video and it can be played

<video src="" controls="controls" preload="auto">your brower or site not support play video</video>


## iframe embedded web page

The code shared by the general video platform can be used directly, you can set the width and height slightly

<iframe src="//player.bilibili.com/player.html?aid=52613549&bvid=BV144411J72P&cid=92076022&page=1" scrolling="no" border="0" frameborder="no" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen=" true" style="width:43vw;height:34vw;min-width: 85%;"> </iframe>
