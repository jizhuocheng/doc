* Then generate secrets, we got client ID and secrets
* Fill in `Homepage URL` with url, e.g. `https://teedoc.github.io`
* Fill in `Authorization callback URL` with `https://teedoc.github.io/`


### Config doc

To use it, you need to add a plug-in in the `site_config` file
```json
    "teedoc-plugin-gitalk": {
        "from": "pypi",
        "config": {
            "contrainer": "comments-container",
            "env": {
                "clientID": "********",
                "clientSecret": "********",
                "repo": "repo name",
                "owner": "orgnization name or user name",
                "admin": ["user names have write access"]
            }
        }
    }
```

* `contrainer`: The container tag `id` that contains the comments, the default is `comments-container`, the document page and blog page in the `teedoc-plugin-theme-default` plugin contain this tag
* `env`: `gitalk` js plugin configuration items, see [here](https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk#options) for more parameters.
  * `clientID` and `clientSecret`: You need to create a new application in [github application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) to get `ID` and `Secret`
  * `repo` and `owner`: are the name and owner of the repository, for example, [github.com/teedoc/teedoc.github.io](https://github.com/teedoc/teedoc.github.io) is used here `issue` as a comment system, just fill in `teedoc.github.io` and `teedoc`
  * `admin`: is the name of the user who has write access to this repository
  * `adminAutoCreate`: Automatically create issue when first time administrator visit page or not
  * `main_color`: the main appearance color of comments, optional
  * `second_color`: the secondary appearance color of comments, optional


~~**To open a comment on each page, the administrator needs to log in to `gitalk` to access the page, `gitalk` will automatically create an issue, and add the label `Gitalk` and the label `url path`, (the path characters are `50` characters in length limit).** Of course, there are also methods for batch creation, which are not introduced here, and you can explore it yourself.~~ Now issue can be created automatically


You can also manually create `issue` and specify the label `Gitalk` of `issue` (the first letter is capitalized), and then add another label `page url path` or `custom id` (the label is custom `id` then Need to set the page `id` on the page using this `issue`)

In addition to setting the `env` parameter in `site_config`, it can also be set in the article's `metadata`. Add a `gitalk-` prefix in front of the setting. For example, to set the `title` of the `issue` generated by `gitalk`, just You can set `gitalk-title`. Here are a few examples:

* If you create an issue manually, you can specify the issue for a page, and specify the issue number in the metadata for the article

```markdown
---
title: *****
gitalk-number: 2
---
```

* Or create an issue manually first, specify the use of the specific label issue on the page, you can take a look at [official example](https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk/issues/1)


```markdown
---
title: *****
id: Demo
---
```

or

```markdown
---
title: *****
gitalk-id: Demo
---
```

## `teedoc-plugin-assets`: assets add plugin

You can freely add resources to the page through this plug-in, such as `css` and `js` resource files

For example, the path mapping of resource files has been added, and there are two files `/static/css/custom.css` and `/static/css/custom.js`, which need to be added to the head and tail of the page respectively.
At the same time, I also hope to add a `meta` tag to the head

`site_config.json`:

```json
{
    "route": {
            "assets": {
                "/static/": "static",
            },
        },
    "plugins": {
        "teedoc-plugin-assets":{
            "from": "pypi",
            "config": {
                "header_items": [
                    "/static/css/custom.css",
                    "<meta name=\"plugin-assets\" content=\"example meta item\">"
                ],
                "footer_items": [
                    "/static/css/custom.js"
                ],
                "env":{
                    "main_color": "#000000"
                }
            }
        },
    }
}
```
For `css` and `js` files, you can write `url` directly like this, or you can write a link at the beginning of `http`.

Here the variables in `env` will be replaced in the resource file, and used in the resource file by `${variable name}`

`custom.css`:

```css
a {
    color: ${main_color}
}
```


## `teedoc-plugin-google-translate`: Google page translation plugin

The function is the same as that of the right mouse button of `Chrome` to translate this page

Before translation:

![google translate](../../assets/images/google_translate0.png)

After translation:

![google translate](../../assets/images/google_translate.png)



```json
"config": {
    "lang": "auto",
    "doc_types": ["page", "doc", "blog"],
    "domain": "/"
}
```

* `lang`: The language of the page that needs to be translated. By default, it is not recommended to set it, or set it to the same `locale` of the document. For example, if `locale` is `zh_CN`, this can be set to `zh-CN `
* `doc_types`: Which types of document pages should be displayed, 0 to 3 of `["page", "doc", "blog"]`,
* `domain`: From which URL to download the source code of `google translate`, the default is `"/"`, which means to download from this website, it can also be set to `translate.google.com` or `translate.google.cn`
> Mainly considering that some files cannot be downloaded without a proxy in China, it is actually necessary to request `translate.googleapis.com`. When making the plug-in, I found that even if it is set to `translate.google.cn`, there is a ` The js` file requested a `cleardot.gif` file under the domain name of `google.com`, which caused the network request to be stuck for a long time until it timed out to load the translation, so the `js` file (`element_main.js`) was modified and Put it locally so that it can be accessed quickly.
> But this is also risky. Because the code and the code of the `Google` server are separated, in case `Google` updates the code one day, we also need to update it manually (although it will not change with a high probability), then welcome to update and modify. Submit PR

### i18n

If the document has multiple languages, you can configure the plugin in `site_config`:
```json
"plugins": {
     "teedoc-plugin-ad-hint": {
         "from": "pypi",
         "config": {
             "type": "hint",
             "label": "â˜†",
             "content": "content",
             "show_after_s": 432000
         }
     }
}
```

Then overwrite the settings in the document `config` in different languages
```json
"plugins": {
     "teedoc-plugin-ad-hint": {
         "config": {
             "label": "ðŸ¦€",
             "content": "Content, support html syntax, do not use English single quotes",
         }
     }
}
```

Try to use the same `config` template file for documents in the same language. In the specific document `config`, `import` makes it easier to configure


## `teedoc-plugin-thumbs-up`: thumbs up plugin

With this plugin, you can display the like button on the page, and you can count the number of likes. The effect is as follows
![thumbs_up.png](../../assets/images/thumbs_up.png)

### Basic usage

Add the plugin in `site_config`:
```json
"plugins": {
    "teedoc-plugin-thumbs-up": {
        "from": "pypi",
        "config": {
            "url": "https://xxxx.xxxx.com:80",
            "show_up_count": true,
            "show_down_count": false
        }
    }
}
```

It should be noted that because the web page is a purely static page, the use of this plug-in needs to be used with the server, and the statistical information is stored on the server.

The server uses the `pip install teedoc-plugin-thumbs-up` command to install the plugin and then use the `teedoc-thumbs-up-server` command to run the service. You can use the `--port` parameter to specify the port, and more parameters use `teedoc' -thumbs-up-server --help`View
> It is recommended to proxy this service with a proxy server such as nginx.
> In addition, if your website is https protocol, then this service also needs to be https service, you can apply for a free certificate and configure it with nginx

It should be noted that this service is just a simple routine and does not fully guarantee the security of the service. It is recommended to read the server code carefully to modify and customize your own server script. Code: [teedoc-plugin-thumbs-up/server](https ://github.com/teedoc/teedoc/tree/main/plugins/teedoc-plugin-thumbs-up/server)

### i18n

Like other plugins, override the settings in the document `config` in different languages. For parameters, see [Plugin Source Default Configuration](https://github.com/teedoc/teedoc/blob/a8b93a4f29330b018c2e38589786b33d00854309/plugins/teedoc-plugin-thumbs- up/teedoc_plugin_thumbs_up/__init__.py#L24)
```json
"plugins": {
    "teedoc-plugin-thumbs-up": {
        "config": {
            "label_up": "Helpful",
            "label_down": "Not helpful",
            "msg_already_voted": "You have already voted",
            "msg_thanks": "Thanks for your feedback",
            "msg_down_prompt": "Thanks for the feedback, please tell us where we can improve? (minimum 10 words)",
            "msg_down_prompt_error": "Message requires a minimum of 10 words and a maximum of 256 words",
            "msg_error": "There was an error requesting the server!"
        }
    }
}
```
