In order to allow users in various places to access the site more quickly, you can use CDN acceleration,
A brief introduction to the principle is to first put the website on an origin server, and then synchronize this resource to nodes across the country or even the world.
The browser wants to access the website through the domain name. The server pointed to by this domain name only does one thing, which is to resolve the location of the browser, and then return it to the IP address of the node closest to the browser, and then the browser directly visits the nearest node To accelerate


First find a CDN provider, such as Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud and Qiniu Cloud.

Then the steps are as follows:

## create origin server


Create the source server by yourself. After the source server is updated, the service provider automatically updates to each node.

Create a website according to the previous method and get `domain name A`, such as `teedoc.github.io`


## Add CDN acceleration to website

If it is a service provider in China, you need to have a registered `domain name B` first, then register and log in, add a `CDN` service, and set the back-to-origin site to the previously established website `domain name A`.

Then visit `domain name B`, the service provider will automatically pull the webpage from `domain name A` and synchronize it to each node in the country or the world, and then the user will be redirected to the `IP` of the node closest to the user when they visit `domain name B`. to ensure the fastest browsing speed
